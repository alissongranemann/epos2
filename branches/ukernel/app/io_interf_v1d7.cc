/* Specification:
 *
 * This application is composed by Domain 0 and Domain 1 that executes a
 * BE task that sets up a TCP/IP server and prints data from the received
 * TCP/IP packets.
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 * This file implements Domain 1.
 * Assuming Domain 0 is implemented in pc_loader.cc
