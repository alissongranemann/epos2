/* Description at
 * Experiments_IO_Interf, Experiment 15 (wiki-experiments.os.git)
 *
 * Specification:
 * There are three domains
 * Domain 0.
 * The VCPU of Domain 0 runs on PCPU (core) 0.
 * It receives interrupts from NIC (because of TCP/IP packets that come from the network).
 *
 * Domain 1.
 * The VCPU of Domain 1 runs on PCPU 1 and executes a hard real-time task.
 *
 * Domain 2
 * The VCPU of Domain 2 runs on PCPU 2 and executes an software real-time /
 * best-effort task printing data from the received TCP/IP packets.
 *
 * Assumed that
 * Task on Guest OS == VCPU == EPOS Thread at private task
 *
 * Variations from the specification:
 * For now, Domain 0 and Domain 2 are kind of mixed together since Domain 2 is
 * getting its packets using the kernel and not communicating with Domain 0
 * (through IPC) and Domain 0 is doing nothing.
 *
 * Additional notes:
 * The interrupt is received by the hardware, by the I/O APIC and routed to:
 * CPU 0? all CPUs? (test that).
 *
 * If Domain 0 is at CPU 0 then we could have a separation from Domain 0 and Domain 2.
 * However, Domain 2 should still need to use a kind of IPC to get data from Domain 0, right?
 *
